## Options

### `--stage`

Controls what to stage before committing:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `all` | Stage all changes including untracked files (default) |
| `tracked` | Stage only modified tracked files |
| `none` | Don't stage anything, commit only what's already staged |

```console
wt step commit --stage=tracked
```

Configure the default in user config:

```toml
[commit]
stage = "tracked"
```

### `--show-prompt`

Output the rendered LLM prompt to stdout without running the command. Useful for inspecting prompt templates or piping to other tools:

```console
# Inspect the rendered prompt
wt step commit --show-prompt | less

# Pipe to a different LLM
wt step commit --show-prompt | llm -m gpt-5-nano

    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Git worktrees share the repository but not untracked files. This command copies gitignored files to another worktree, eliminating cold starts.

## Setup

Add to the project config:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

## What gets copied

All gitignored files are copied by default. Tracked files are never touched.

To limit what gets copied, create `.worktreeinclude` with gitignore-style patterns. Files must be **both** gitignored **and** in `.worktreeinclude`:

```gitignore
# .worktreeinclude
.env
node_modules/
target/
```

## Common patterns

| Type | Patterns |
|------|----------|
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `Pods/` |
| Build caches | `.cache/`, `.next/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/` |
| Generated assets | Images, ML models, binaries too large for git |
| Environment files | `.env` (if not generated per-worktree) |

## Features

- Uses copy-on-write (reflink) when available for space-efficient copies
- Handles nested `.gitignore` files, global excludes, and `.git/info/exclude`
- Skips existing files by default (safe to re-run)
- `--force` overwrites existing files in the destination
- Skips `.git` entries and other worktrees

## Performance

Reflink copies share disk blocks until modified — no data is actually copied. For a 14GB `target/` directory:

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `cp -R` (full copy) | 2m |
| `cp -Rc` / `wt step copy-ignored` | 20s |

Uses per-file reflink (like `cp -Rc`) — copy time scales with file count.

Use the `post-start` hook so the copy runs in the background. Use `post-create` instead if subsequent hooks or `--execute` command need the copied files immediately.

## Language-specific notes

### Rust

The `target/` directory is huge (often 1-10GB). Copying with reflink cuts first build from ~68s to ~3s by reusing compiled dependencies.

### Node.js

`node_modules/` is large but mostly static. If the project has no native dependencies, symlinks are even faster:

```toml
[post-create]
deps = "ln -sf {{ primary_worktree_path }}/node_modules ."
```

### Python

Virtual environments contain absolute paths and can't be copied. Use `uv sync` instead — it's fast enough that copying isn't worth it.

## Behavior vs Claude Code on desktop

The `.worktreeinclude` pattern is shared with [Claude Code on desktop](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), which copies matching files when creating worktrees. Differences:

- worktrunk copies all gitignored files by default; Claude Code requires `.worktreeinclude`
- worktrunk uses copy-on-write for large directories like `target/` — potentially 30x faster on macOS, 6x on Linux
- worktrunk runs as a configurable hook in the worktree lifecycle

## Template variables

All variables are shell-escaped. See [`wt hook` template variables](@/hook.md#template-variables) for the complete list and filters.

## Examples

Check status across all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- git status --short
```

Run npm install in all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- npm install
```

Use branch name in command:

```console
wt step for-each -- "echo Branch: {{ branch }}"
```

Pull updates in worktrees with upstreams (skips others):

```console
git fetch --prune && wt step for-each -- '[ "$(git rev-parse @{u} 2>/dev/null)" ] || exit 0; git pull --autostash'
```

Note: This command is experimental and may change in future versions.

    ForEach {

        #[arg(required = true, last = true, num_args = 1..)]
        args: Vec<String>,
    },

    /// \[experimental\] Move worktrees to expected paths
    ///
    /// Relocates worktrees whose path doesn't match the `worktree-path` template.
    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Moves worktrees to match the configured `worktree-path` template.

## Examples

Preview what would be moved:

```console
wt step relocate --dry-run
```

Move all mismatched worktrees:

```console
wt step relocate
```

Auto-commit and clobber blockers (never fails):

```console
wt step relocate --commit --clobber
```

Move specific worktrees:

```console
wt step relocate feature bugfix
```

## Swap handling

When worktrees are at each other's expected locations (e.g., `alpha` at
`repo.beta` and `beta` at `repo.alpha`), relocate automatically resolves
this by using a temporary location.

## Clobbering

With `--clobber`, non-worktree paths at target locations are moved to
`<path>.bak-<timestamp>` before relocating.

## Main worktree behavior

The main worktree can't be moved with `git worktree move`. Instead, relocate
switches it to the default branch and creates a new linked worktree at the
expected path. Untracked and gitignored files remain at the original location.

## Skipped worktrees

- **Dirty** (without `--commit`) — use `--commit` to auto-commit first
- **Locked** — unlock with `git worktree unlock`
- **Target blocked** (without `--clobber`) — use `--clobber` to backup blocker
- **Detached HEAD** — no branch to compute expected path

Note: This command is experimental and may change in future versions.
