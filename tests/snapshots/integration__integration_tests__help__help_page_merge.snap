## Examples

Basic merge to main:

```bash
wt merge
```

Merge to a different branch:

```bash
wt merge develop
```

Keep the worktree after merging:

```bash
wt merge --no-remove
```

Preserve commit history (no squash):

```bash
wt merge --no-squash
```

Skip git operations, only run hooks and push:

```bash
wt merge --no-commit
```

## Pipeline

`wt merge` runs these steps:

1. **Squash** — Stages uncommitted changes, then combines all commits since target into one (like GitHub's "Squash and merge"). Use `--stage` to control what gets staged: `all` (default), `tracked`, or `none`. A backup ref is saved to `refs/wt-backup/<branch>`. With `--no-squash`, uncommitted changes become a separate commit and individual commits are preserved.
2. **Rebase** — Rebases onto target if behind. Skipped if already up-to-date. Conflicts abort immediately.
3. **Pre-merge hooks** — Project commands run after rebase, before merge. Failures abort. See [wt hook](@/hook.md).
4. **Merge** — Fast-forward merge to the target branch. Non-fast-forward merges are rejected.
5. **Pre-remove hooks** — Project commands run before removing worktree. Failures abort.
6. **Cleanup** — Removes the worktree and branch. Use `--no-remove` to keep the worktree. When already on the target branch or in the main worktree, the worktree is preserved.
7. **Post-merge hooks** — Project commands run after cleanup. Failures are logged but don't abort.

Use `--no-commit` to skip all git operations (steps 1-2) and only run hooks and merge. Useful after preparing commits manually with `wt step`. Requires a clean working tree.
