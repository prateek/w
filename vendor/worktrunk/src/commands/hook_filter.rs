//! Hook filter types for command filtering by source and name.

//! These types are shared between `hooks.rs` (command preparation/execution)

//! for backward compatibility.

/// Distinguishes between user hooks and project hooks for command preparation.
///
/// Approval for project hooks is handled at the gate (command entry point),
/// not during hook execution.

/// Supports formats:
/// - `"foo"` - matches commands named "foo" from any source
/// - `"user:foo"` - matches only user's command named "foo"
/// - `"project:foo"` - matches only project's command named "foo"
/// - `"user:"` or `"project:"` - matches all commands from that source
